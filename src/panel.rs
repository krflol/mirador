//! The [`Panel`] trait: the seam every dashboard widget goes through.
//!
//! This remains an in-tree seam, not the public plugin API. External plugins
//! run out of process and speak a small, versioned protocol; [`crate::plugin`]
//! adapts that protocol to this trait. Keeping the boundary there means a
//! plugin cannot couple itself to ratatui, Mirador's private Rust types, or its
//! release cadence, and the core never needs to embed a language runtime.
//!
//! What the seam does buy, in-tree, is real: a panel owns its own state and
//! refresh cadence. The application shell is
//! responsible only for layout, focus, frames and dispatching ticks and key
//! events; it knows nothing about what any individual panel displays.
//!
//! # Why the description is six methods and not one
//!
//! `title`, `counter`, `bindings`, `max_width`, `max_height` and
//! `refresh_interval` are all "describe yourself", and folding them into one
//! `describe() -> PanelInfo` would take the trait from thirteen methods to
//! eight. It would also be slower and less useful, because the six are asked
//! for at different times and at very different rates: `max_width` and
//! `max_height` during layout, `refresh_interval` on the tick, `bindings` in
//! three separate places, and `title` and `counter` on **every frame** — the
//! last two from the shell's render loop, where nothing guards them.
//!
//! A single `describe()` would compute all six whenever any one was wanted,
//! and return an owned struct carrying a `String` title and an
//! `Option<String>` counter — so the cheapest question would allocate twice,
//! sixty times a second, per panel. The trait is wide because the shell's
//! questions are genuinely separate.
