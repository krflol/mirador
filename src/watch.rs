//! Notable things that happened, and when.
//!
//! The design thesis names three instruments — chronometer, weather glass,
//! **watch log** — and for a long time only two of them existed. This is the
//! third: a record of what happened while you were not looking.
//!
//! ## What counts
//!
//! Almost nothing does, and that is the point. The clock, the readings, the
//! prices and the graphs change continuously and none of it is news; the notes
//! and tasks change because *you* changed them. An event is something that
//! happened **to** you rather than because of you, and that you would want to
//! know about even if you never looked at the panel it came from. That leaves a
//! very short list, which is the correct size for it.
//!
//! ## Why it is not a badge
//!
//! Unread message counts were considered for this dashboard and rejected —
//! "looks like information, is a doomscroll hook, turns a calm dashboard into a
//! nagging one". Read closely, that objection is about the *badge*: a number
//! that accumulates and demands you zero it.
//!
//! So the log has no count, no unread state, and no effect on any other panel's
//! appearance. It is a record you consult, not an inbox that consults you. If
//! you never place the panel, nothing about mirador changes. Breaking any of
//! those three is how this feature turns into the one that was rejected.
//!
//! ## Why it does not persist
//!
//! A log written to disk would come back after a restart with a hole in it —
//! the hours mirador was not running, during which it observed nothing and
//! cannot say so. Weather shows the age of its reading rather than pretending
//! it is current, and this follows the same rule: the log starts when mirador
//! does and says so, rather than implying a completeness it does not have.
